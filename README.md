# Random Choice Picker

This is the Random Choice Picker project (Day 13) in the [Udemy course 50 projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50+projects+50+days).

## Project Details

The goal of the project is to create an application that allows the user to input several options and then, upon completion of choice input, it randomly selects one of the options. Great for scenarios when the user is uncdecided and is looking for a random answer to the possible choices.
